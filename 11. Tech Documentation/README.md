# Technical Documentation: A Quick Guide

## Introduction

Technical documentation is the backbone of any product, system, or process. It refers to the structured information created to explain how something works, how to use it, or how to maintain it. Good documentation ensures that knowledge is not locked in the minds of a few individuals but can be shared, understood, and acted upon by anyone who needs it.

Whether you are building software, operating hardware, or managing organizational workflows, technical documentation plays a crucial role in improving usability, reducing errors, and saving time for both users and teams.
