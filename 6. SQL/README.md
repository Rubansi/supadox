# SQL Learning Journey 🚀

## 💡Introduction
Welcome to my SQL learning repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my journey through various SQL concepts, from the basics to more advanced topics. My goal is to create a comprehensive resource that showcases my understanding, provides practical examples, and serves as a quick reference for common SQL operations.

## 🛠️ Setup and Prerequisites
To run the SQL examples in this repository, you'll need a SQL database system installed. I recommend using one of the following:

- **SQLite:** Lightweight and serverless, great for quick testing.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source relational database system.
- **MySQL:** Another popular open-source relational database.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized by SQL concept. Each folder typically contains:

- `README.md`: A brief explanation of the concept and key syntax.
- `.sql` files: Practical examples demonstrating the concept.
