# ðŸ“˜ Version Control with Git and GitHub â€“ Documentation

------

## 1. Introduction to Version Control

**What is Version Control?**
 Version Control is a system that records changes to files over time so you can recall specific versions later. It allows individuals and teams to:

- Track the history of changes.
- Revert to previous versions when needed.
- Collaborate without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.

**Why Version Control is Important**

- Ensures a history of project changes.
- Allows collaboration among multiple developers.
- Supports branching and experimentation.
- Prevents data loss.

**Types of Version Control Systems**

1. **Local Version Control** â€“ Keeps changes in your local machine (e.g., RCS).
2. **Centralized Version Control** â€“ A single server stores all versions (e.g., SVN, CVS).
3. **Distributed Version Control (DVCS)** â€“ Every user has a full copy of the repository (e.g., Git, Mercurial).

ðŸ‘‰ Git is the most popular DVCS today.
