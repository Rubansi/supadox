# 📘 Version Control with Git and GitHub – Documentation

------

## 1. Introduction to Version Control

**What is Version Control?**
 Version Control is a system that records changes to files over time so you can recall specific versions later. It allows individuals and teams to:

- Track the history of changes.
- Revert to previous versions when needed.
- Collaborate without overwriting each other’s work.

**Why Version Control is Important**

- Ensures a history of project changes.
- Allows collaboration among multiple developers.
- Supports branching and experimentation.
- Prevents data loss.

**Types of Version Control Systems**

1. **Local Version Control** – Keeps changes in your local machine (e.g., RCS).
2. **Centralized Version Control** – A single server stores all versions (e.g., SVN, CVS).
3. **Distributed Version Control (DVCS)** – Every user has a full copy of the repository (e.g., Git, Mercurial).

👉 Git is the most popular DVCS today.

## 2. Introduction to Git

**What is Git?**
 Git is a free, open-source, distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. It is optimized for speed, flexibility, and collaboration.

**Why Git?**

- Distributed: Every developer has the full history of the project.
- Fast: Operations are local, making them faster.
- Branching: Easy to create, merge, and delete branches.
- Popular: Used in most modern software projects.

**Key Concepts**

- **Repository (Repo):** A project’s folder tracked by Git.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of project changes.
- **Branch:** A parallel line of development.
- **Merge:** Combining changes from different branches.
- **Remote:** A version of the repo hosted online (e.g., GitHub).
